          <h2> Description</h2>
      </p>
      <p>Something of the cheese fondue here. I suggest using a full-flavoured extra mature cheddar.</p>
      <p>Stock can be chicken or vegetable but either way homemade is preferable. </p>
      <ul>
          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <li>Onions x2</li>
          <li>Butter 30g</li>
          <li>Carrots x2</li>
          <li>Celery 1 stick</li>
          <li>Milk 400ml</li>
          <li>Plain Flour 45g</li>
          <li>Stock 400ml</li>
          <li>Dijon Mustard 1 tsp</li>
          <li>Cheddar 400g</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
          <h2>Method</h2>
              <li>Peel and roughly chops the onions before gently frying with the butter in a deep saucepan over moderate heat.</li>
              <li>Finely dice the carrot and celery before adding to the onions to continue softening gently for 10 mins.</li>
              <li>Stir the flour into the vegetables and cook out the flour for 3 mins then add the milk and stir to a thick sauce.</li>
              <li>Pour in the stock and cider bringing it to the boil then reducing heat to simmer for a few mins. Add mustard and season to taste.</li>
              <li>Grate the cheddar and stir into soup to melt, making sure not to boil as this can cause the soup to split. Serve with crusty bread to dunk.</li>
              
            </ol>
