        <h2> Description</h2>
    </p>
    <p>Few things are better than this succulent pork under its crust of salty crackling. </p>
    <p>The recipe is simple but the main thing to remember is patience over the cooking time is rewarded with a glass-like crunch on the crackling. </p>
    <ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>Pork Belly 1.2kg</li>
        <li>Red Wine Vinegar 2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Onions x2</li>
        <li>Salt 2 tsp</li>
        <li>Garlic 2 cloves</li>
        <li>Rosemary fresh 2 sprigs leaves only</li>
       
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h2>Method</h2>
            <li>Boil the kettle and as soon as it is ready pour the water over the skin of the crackling after placing it on a wire rack over your baking tray.</li>
            <li>Pat the pork dry and tip away the water from the tin. Drizzle the vinegar over the skin and place pork in the fridge to dry out for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove pork from fridge to come up to room temp for 30 mins before cooking. Mash salt garlic and chopped rosemary to a paste and spread over the skin.</li>
            <li>Quarter the onions and place in base of tray with 2 tbsp water. Place wire rack over the tray and the pork on the rack skin side up.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 220c and roast for 30 min before reducing to 150c for 1hr 30 min. Take a look to check crackling is fully crisp and don't be afraid to leave in up to 30 mins more. </li>

        
    </ol>
